It affects conversions. 
It makes it possible to get your product into low-bandwidth and mobile-only areas. 
Users get more work done before running out of patience or time. 
There's lots of evidence and studies for all of this.

- (Pacific Islands, Africa, South Asia, South America)

### Users get more work done before running of patience or time
- Nobody likes waiting, and patience and willpower are finite. If our experience is slow, 
users would rather be somewhere else, like Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Baidu, etc.

### Here are some web performance experiments to prove it

**Akamai and Gomez.com found:**

- [Speed is a Killer - KissMetrics](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/speed-is-a-killer/) 
- Nearly half of web users expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less. - Users tend to 
abandon a site that isn't loaded within 3 seconds. - 79% of web shoppers who have trouble 
with site performance say they won't return to buy again and around 44% would tell a friend 
if they had a poor experience

**Google found:**  

- [Half a second delay caused a 20% drop in traffic](http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/11/marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html)
- [77% of searches from mobile devices take place at home or work, only 17% on the move.](https://hbr.org/2013/05/the-rise-of-the-mobile-only-us/)

**Amazon found:**  

- [Every 100ms increase in load time decreased sales by 1%](http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/psychology-web-performance/)

**HTTPArchive found:**  

- [Between 2011 and 2015, pagesize increased by nearly 3x, topping 2,000 kB (709kB to 2,008 kB)](http://httparchive.org/compare.php?&r1=Aug%2015%202011&s1=Top1000&r2=Aug%2015%202015&s2=Top1000)

**Ericsson Mobility Report found:**  

- While mobile 3G and 4G LTE subscriptions are increasing rapidly, 2G-level subscriptions are 
currently around 4.5 billion, and 
[will still stay as high as 2 billion until around the year 2020.](http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/2015/ericsson-mobility-report-june-2015.pdf) 
This means keeping site weight low will continue to stay important for several years to come(pg. 7)
- [Mobile saturation for China, Africa, and India are still below 100%](http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/2015/ericsson-mobility-report-june-2015.pdf), 
so we can expect several more mobile-only users coming online in the next few years, Many of 
whom have only used internet on a mobile device.(pg. 5)
- ["90% of the world's population over 6 years old will have a mobile phone by 2020" (pg. 6)](http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/2015/ericsson-mobility-report-june-2015.pdf)
- Central Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific are [still predominantly 2G-based mobile subscriptions](http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/2015/ericsson-mobility-report-june-2015.pdf), 
and will still be under 50% LTE by 2020 (pg. 9)
