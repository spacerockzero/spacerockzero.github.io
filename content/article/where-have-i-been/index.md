**It's true, I let this blog langish.**

I was busy having too much fun, and forgot to tell you all about it.

When the pandemic hit in early 2020, I decided to finally get to learning some AI and Machine Learning stuff, for some dream projects I had in mind for a while. Being bored at home, and wanting to better and distract myself caused me to push it hard. I committed to create one ML-generated piece of content per week, to give me the pressure to learn and grow.

I made a blog to share the stories:

And another site to share some weird experiments:

I learned Python to do some Natural Language Processing stuff, since I wanted to generate text to automate writing some Children's stories using some Machine Learning. I found that many of the text processing libraries and processes I used were far too slow, or had dumb memory limitations, so I did something truly strange...

I learned a new systems language ([Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)) to try to build a faster system. I still feel weak at it, but I can make things. I'm not nimble enough to prototype ideas in it yet, so I still do that in javascript or python.

I still generate all the ML stuff in python, but all the document processing, plagiarism detection, string comparisons, de-duping, data munging, database bulk uploading, are all done in Rust now, and I'm pretty happy with the speed. It's 100-1000x faster and lighter on resources than what I was doing in Python, which was admittedly a bit noobish on its' efficiency to start with.

I'm still not satisfied with the scrappy state of the data processing pipeline's code, but when it wouldn't even complete runs in python or nodejs when processing hundreds of thousands of text or json files, something that worked at all was nice. Something 100x faster was reeeeeeeally nice.

My list of projects still grows faster than my list of completed projects. So much to learn, so much to try out in the world of the future. 

I can't wait.
