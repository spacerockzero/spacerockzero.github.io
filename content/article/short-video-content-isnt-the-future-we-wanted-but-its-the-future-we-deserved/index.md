## Time to Spew Some Carelessly Over-Generalized Sentiments:

Many attention spans are getting shorter, and content is getting shorter to meet it. It reminds me of this essay I read in college: [Is Google Making Us Stupid?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_Google_Making_Us_Stupid%3F). The follow-up research after that essay mostly concluded that with the quick, accessible readiness of information, the way we adapt to new information technologies DO CHANGE US. It might not be worse, but it is certainly DIFFERENT.

## Change is the only constant.

Lately around me, pre-judgments and weak heuristics feel like they're chosen more often over painstakingly-researched ponderances. (They are calorically cheaper by effort)

But you forget how bad it is once you're immersed. Dopamine-targeted, brain-stimulating slot-machine emotional short wins, pixelated blue-led photons straight to the retina, and cheap energy drinks might be the only thing motivating our burnt-out corpses in this exhausting world, hehehe. (Sorry, I spend too much time with [Negatron AI](https://ai.eclecticbeams.com/negatron/))

Maybe I'm reading too many Behavioral Economics books lately, with their focus on "humans aren't making logical choices, they're making emotional ones, then rationalizing their behavior without realizing it."

Because many of the metrics that tune the content preferences in this system use passive attention methods (play time), and not just active engagement ("like" buttons, "sharing", etc.), you might not realize you're incidentally reinforcing it's belief you wanted to see more of something you didn't enjoy, but were compelled to keep watching. Behavioral Economists would say "forget what they say, watch what they do.". It might not feel like it, but staying on a video is a decision the same way that leaving, or "liking" a video is.

## What I've been getting at in this rant...

About a month or so ago, I challenged myself to start making short video content with my AI/ML systems, so I've jumped into the TikToks and Youtube Shorts. 

> It's the worst, but it's probably the future, and the friction is sooooo low for users. 

Psychological mechanisms have strong effects here. The algorithm is treated like a whimsical deity. One that no one understands, not even the creators. Following the "learn by doing" lean startup approach, I'm making tons of things quickly, experimenting, seeing what works, and refining the process as I go. It's a weird world. I'm sure re-using my old film editing and typography college credits, previously lost in my dusty mental attic behind a cardboard box with the very helpful label "stuff".
